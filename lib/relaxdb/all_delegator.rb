  #
  # The AllDelegator allows clients to query CouchDB in a natural way
  #   FooDoc.all - returns all docs in CouchDB of type FooDoc
  #   FooDoc.all.sorted_by(:att1, :att2) - returns all docs in CouchDB of type FooDoc sorted by att1, then att2
  #   FooDoc.all.sorted_by(:att1) { |q| q.key("bar") } - returns all docs of type FooDoc where att1 equals "bar"
  #   FooDoc.all.destroy! - does what it says on the tin
  #   FooDoc.all.size - issues a query to a reduce function that returns the total number of docs for that class
